# Beyoncé Week
A website celebrating the intersection of law and technology. I served as the Project Manager for UMBC’s Technology Law students, Fall 2024, alongside Professor Scott. We started with empty pages and built the site from scratch. I created tutorial videos to guide students in web development, page creation, animations, and Photoshop work, including placing images and videos on the pages.

# Beyoncé Week - Where Passion Meets Law at UMBC (2024)
This website explores Beyoncé’s influence on law and technology at UMBC. It features topics such as fashion, animation, music, and sports related to law, with artwork by Nikita Waghode. A work-in-progress video of The Book of Life, shared by Jorge Gutierrez, is included on the site.
